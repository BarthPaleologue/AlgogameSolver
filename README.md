# AlgogameSolver

Algogame is a puzzle game centered around algorithmic concepts such as functions and recursion. It can be some kind of a hassle sometimes so it appeared necessary to create a solution capable of breaking any level of the game.


### Breaking a specific level

First, you need to procure a map of the level (see level38.txt for the color conventions). 

Note that it's important for the solver's functionment that you add a padding of "white cases" on each border.
